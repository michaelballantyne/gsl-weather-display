/* ================INSTRUCTIONS=================*/ 
/* By changing the classes below, you can add your own custom styles for various areas of the header. In order for your changes to work though, you MUST include a reference in your HTML pages to both the common CSS file and custom CSS file in that order.

Instructions are provided below for customizing these classes.

/* ================BANNER=======================*/  
/* TO DISPLAY A CUSTOM BANNER IMAGE: 
If you want to display a custom banner, change the "background: url" to point to a local banner, or external, image location.

TO DISPLAY A CUSTOM BANNER COLOR (NO IMAGE): 
If you would rather display a color instead of a banner image, change the "background: url" portion to point to "" and set the background color (#006633) to whatever color you wish to display.
NOTE: You can use either hexadecimal color codes (i.e. - #006633, #063) or HTML color names (i.e. - "black"). */ 
#usgscolorband { 
	background: #82643c url("/images/banners/banner.jpg") 178px 0px no-repeat; 
} 
/* ================SITE TITLE===================*/ 
/* TO DISPLAY A CUSTOM SITE TITLE BAR: 
The #usgstitle class is specific to the colored site title bar that lies beneath the USGS identifier. To change the color of this bar, set the "background-color" attribute below to the color you wish to display and change the "color" attribute to set the text color.
NOTE: You can use either hexadecimal color codes (i.e. - #000000) or HTML color names (i.e. - "black"). */ 
#usgstitle { 
    background-color: #82643c; 
    color: #ffffff; 
} 
/* =============STANDARD CONTENT===============*/ 
/* TO CHANGE THE TEXT SIZE OF THE CONTENT:
By default, USGS has set the font size to "small" in order to provide a consistent size for content across all pages. If you would prefer not to have a pre-defined font size for your pages, change the "font-size" attributes below to "font-size: 100%;". */
